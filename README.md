The first homework for my CSE214 Data Structures class. This program is a course planner where the user can 
record the courses they want to take in order of preferences. There is also a menu/prompt system where courses
can be manipulated or searched up by certain attributes such as name, department, instructor, etc.

Things I learned:
  - Handling exceptions
  - Java syntax
  - String formatting
  - Array data structure
